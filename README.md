This project offers a real-time tracker for the International Space Station (ISS) on a dynamic Leaflet map. The tracker updates the ISS location periodically, allowing users to follow its journey as it orbits the Earth.

## Key Features:

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Keep tabs on the ISS as it orbits the Earth with live location updates.

- **Location Categorization:** Discover where the ISS is currently positioned by category (e.g., over oceans, continents, specific regions).

- **Timer**: Track how long you've been following the ISS during your session.

- **Wraparound Map:** Seamlessly follow the ISS as it wraps around the world for a continuous viewing experience.
